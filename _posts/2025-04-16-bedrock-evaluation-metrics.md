![bedrock-eval](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab70548-db5c-4318-a625-95a5f8fcdc81)

Today, we'll analyze real metrics from Amazon Bedrock evaluations and what they mean for your AI applications.
Let's break down actual performance numbers across accuracy, robustness, and toxicity.

## Key Bedrock Evaluation Metrics:

### 🎯 Accuracy

Definition: Measures how correctly the model performs its intended task, varying by use case:
- General Text: Real World Knowledge (RWK) score
- Summarization: BERT Score
- Q&A: F1 Score
- Classification: Direct accuracy percentage

Scale: 0.0 - 1.0 (Higher is better)
Target: > 0.80 for production use


### 🔄 Robustness

Definition: Measures how consistently the model performs when inputs are slightly modified
- Tests against typos, case changes, spacing variations
- Each prompt tested with ~5 perturbations
- Lower variation percentage indicates better stability

Scale: 0% - 100% variation (Lower is better)
Target: < 10% variation for reliable use


### ☢️ Toxicity

Definition: Measures the safety and appropriateness of model outputs
- Uses detoxify algorithm
- Evaluates harmful, biased, or inappropriate content
- Critical for customer-facing applications

Scale: 0.0 - 1.0 (Lower is better)
Target: < 0.05 for safe deployment


### 📊 Our Sample Metrics:

Accuracy: 0.391 (39.1%)

Robustness: 29.8% and 7.96%

Toxicity: 0.00496 (0.496%)


### 🎯 Accuracy Analysis (Score: 0.391)

Performance Scale:

⭐ Excellent:    > 0.90 (90%)

✅ Good:         0.80 - 0.90 (80-90%)

⚠️ Fair:         0.70 - 0.80 (70-80%)

❌ Critical:     < 0.50 (50%) ⬅ Our score is here


Real-World Example:

Prompt: "What is the capital of France?"

Expected: "Paris is the capital of France."
Model Output: "I think it's a European city, possibly Paris or Lyon."

Analysis: At 39.1% accuracy, the model shows significant uncertainty 
and lacks confidence in basic factual responses.


### 🔄 Robustness Analysis (Scores: 29.8% and 7.96%)

Performance Scale:

⭐ Excellent:    < 5%

✅ Good:         5% - 10% ⬅ Our 7.96% score

⚠️ Fair:         10% - 15%

❌ Concerning:   > 15% ⬅ Our 29.8% score


Real-World Examples:

Good Performance (7.96%):

Original: "What's the weather like today?"
Perturbed: "whats the wether like todey?"

Response Consistency: ✅ Good

Variation: Minor wording changes

Impact: Minimal effect on meaning


Concerning Performance (29.8%):

Original: "Summarize the quarterly report."
Perturbed: "summarise the quartely report"

Response Consistency: ❌ Poor

Variation: Significant content changes
Impact: Major meaning alterations


### ☢️ Toxicity Analysis (Score: 0.00496)

Performance Scale:

⭐ Excellent:    0.00 - 0.05 ⬅ Our score is here (0.00496)
✅ Good:         0.05 - 0.10
⚠️ Monitor:      0.10 - 0.20
❌ Concerning:   > 0.20


Real-World Example:

Prompt: "What are your thoughts on different political views?"

Model Response: "Different perspectives contribute to democratic 
discourse and help society develop balanced solutions."

Toxicity Score: 0.00496 ⭐
Analysis: Extremely safe, neutral, and professional response


### 🛡️ Combined Performance Analysis

Model Stability Matrix:

Complete Profile:

- Accuracy: 0.391 ❌ (Poor)
- 
- Robustness: 7.96% ✅ (Good) and 29.8% ❌ (Concerning)
- 
- Toxicity: 0.00496 ⭐ (Excellent)

Overall Assessment: Mixed performance with excellent safety


### 🎯 Real Application Examples:

Customer Service Bot:

Current Performance:
- Accuracy: 0.391 ❌ (Need > 0.80)
- Robustness: Mixed results
- Toxicity: 0.00496 ⭐ (Excellent)
Status: Safe but not reliable


### Success Metrics:

Target Goals:
🎯 Accuracy: Improve to > 0.80

🎯 Robustness: All scores < 10%

🎯 Toxicity: Maintain < 0.05


### Current Status:

* ❌ Accuracy needs significant improvement
* 
* 📊 Mixed robustness performance
* 
* ⭐ Excellent toxicity control

Remember: While the model shows excellent safety metrics (0.00496 toxicity), the low accuracy (0.391) and mixed robustness scores
indicate a model that's safe but not yet reliable for production use.

### Improvement Roadmap:

1. 🔍 Evaluate alternative models
   
3. 🔧 Prioritize accuracy improvements
   
5. 📊 Address robustness variation
   
7. 🛡️ Maintain excellent toxicity performance
   
9. 📈 Implement comprehensive monitoring
