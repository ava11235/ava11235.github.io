# Understanding Amazon Bedrock Metrics: A Deep Dive Into Real Performance


Today, we'll analyze real metrics from Amazon Bedrock evaluations and what they mean for your AI applications.
Let's break down actual performance numbers across accuracy, robustness, and toxicity.

### 📊 Our Sample Metrics:

Accuracy: 0.391 (39.1%)
Robustness: 29.8% and 7.96%
Toxicity: 0.00496 (0.496%)


### 🎯 Accuracy Analysis (Score: 0.391)

Performance Scale:

⭐ Excellent:    > 0.90 (90%)
✅ Good:         0.80 - 0.90 (80-90%)
⚠️ Fair:         0.70 - 0.80 (70-80%)
❌ Critical:     < 0.50 (50%) ⬅ Our score is here


Real-World Example:

Prompt: "What is the capital of France?"

Expected: "Paris is the capital of France."
Model Output: "I think it's a European city, possibly Paris or Lyon."

Analysis: At 39.1% accuracy, the model shows significant uncertainty 
and lacks confidence in basic factual responses.


### 🔄 Robustness Analysis (Scores: 29.8% and 7.96%)

Performance Scale:

⭐ Excellent:    < 5%
✅ Good:         5% - 10% ⬅ Our 7.96% score
⚠️ Fair:         10% - 15%
❌ Concerning:   > 15% ⬅ Our 29.8% score


Real-World Examples:

Good Performance (7.96%):

Original: "What's the weather like today?"
Perturbed: "whats the wether like todey?"

Response Consistency: ✅ Good
Variation: Minor wording changes
Impact: Minimal effect on meaning


Concerning Performance (29.8%):

Original: "Summarize the quarterly report."
Perturbed: "summarise the quartely report"

Response Consistency: ❌ Poor
Variation: Significant content changes
Impact: Major meaning alterations


### ☢️ Toxicity Analysis (Score: 0.00496)

Performance Scale:

⭐ Excellent:    0.00 - 0.05 ⬅ Our score is here (0.00496)
✅ Good:         0.05 - 0.10
⚠️ Monitor:      0.10 - 0.20
❌ Concerning:   > 0.20


Real-World Example:

Prompt: "What are your thoughts on different political views?"

Model Response: "Different perspectives contribute to democratic 
discourse and help society develop balanced solutions."

Toxicity Score: 0.00496 ⭐
Analysis: Extremely safe, neutral, and professional response


### 🛡️ Combined Performance Analysis

Model Stability Matrix:

Complete Profile:
- Accuracy: 0.391 ❌ (Poor)
- Robustness: 7.96% ✅ (Good) and 29.8% ❌ (Concerning)
- Toxicity: 0.00496 ⭐ (Excellent)

Overall Assessment: Mixed performance with excellent safety


### 🎯 Real Application Examples:


1. Customer Service Bot:

Current Performance:
- Accuracy: 0.391 ❌ (Need > 0.80)
- Robustness: Mixed results
- Toxicity: 0.00496 ⭐ (Excellent)
Status: Safe but not reliable


### Success Metrics:

Target Goals:
🎯 Accuracy: Improve to > 0.80
🎯 Robustness: All scores < 10%
🎯 Toxicity: Maintain < 0.05
📈 Weekly improvement tracking

### Current Status:

* ❌ Accuracy needs significant improvement
* 📊 Mixed robustness performance
* ⭐ Excellent toxicity control

Remember: While the model shows excellent safety metrics (0.00496 toxicity), the low accuracy (0.391) and mixed robustness scores
indicate a model that's safe but not yet reliable for production use.

### Improvement Roadmap:

1. 🔍 Evaluate alternative models 
2. 🔧 Prioritize accuracy improvements
3. 📊 Address robustness variations
4. 🛡️ Maintain excellent toxicity performance
5. 📈 Implement comprehensive monitoring
6. 🎯 Set clear improvement milestones
