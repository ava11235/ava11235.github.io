# Hello, MCP! 🤖🔌

## What is MCP? 🧩

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that standardizes how AI models represent and process context, enabling more consistent and predictable interactions across different systems. Often referred to as "the USB-C port for AI," MCP provides a uniform way for Large Language Models (LLMs) to interface with external tools, data, and functionality.

MCP allows developers to:

* Expose data through Resources (similar to GET endpoints)
* Provide functionality through Tools (similar to POST endpoints)
* Define interaction patterns through Prompts (reusable templates)
* Create standardized interfaces between LLMs and external capabilities

Getting Started with fastMCP 🚀

One of the easiest ways to begin working with MCP is through the fastMCP Python SDK. FastMCP provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building and interacting with MCP servers with minimal boilerplate code.

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple "Hello MCP" application that demonstrates how to build an MCP server with tools that a language model can use through AWS Bedrock.


### Prerequisites 🛠️

For this tutorial, I'm using:

* VSCode with  Q Developer CLI
* AWS Bedrock with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku model 
* Configured AWS credentials


Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed and the necessary AWS permissions to access Bedrock models.


### Setting Up Our The Project 📁

Let's start by creating a project directory and the necessary files from your terminal:

``
mkdir hello_mcp``

``cd hello_mcp``



### Building Our MCP Server 🖥️

First, let's create our MCP server file (mcp_server.py) which will expose tools for our LLM to use:



```
cat > mcp_server.py << 'EOL'
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import random

# Initialize FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("hello-MCP-server")

# Define a greeting tool
@mcp.tool()
async def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a person with their name and explain what MCP is."""
    return f"Hello {name}! Welcome to MCP. Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that standardizes how AI models represent and process context, enabling more consistent and predictable interactions across different systems."

# Rock-Paper-Scissors game tool
@mcp.tool()
async def play_rock_paper_scissors(player_move: str) -> str:
    """
    Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.
    
    Args:
        player_move: Your choice of 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'
    
    Returns:
        The result of the game
    """
    # Normalize and validate input
    player_move = player_move.lower().strip()
    valid_moves = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    
    if player_move not in valid_moves:
        return f"Invalid move. Please choose one of: {', '.join(valid_moves)}"
    
    # Computer makes a random move
    computer_move = random.choice(valid_moves)
    
    # Determine winner
    if player_move == computer_move:
        result = "It's a tie!"
    elif (player_move == 'rock' and computer_move == 'scissors') or \
         (player_move == 'paper' and computer_move == 'rock') or \
         (player_move == 'scissors' and computer_move == 'paper'):
        result = "You win!"
    else:
        result = "Computer wins!"
    
    return f"You chose {player_move}, computer chose {computer_move}. {result}"

# Start the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
EOL
```

This server exposes two tools:

1. greet - A function that greets users and explains what MCP is
2. play_rock_paper_scissors - A tool that lets users play the classic game against the computer

### Creating an MCP Client with AWS Bedrock 🧠

Next, let's create our client file (mcp_client.py) which will connect to our MCP server and use AWS Bedrock to interact with Claude:

```

        # Use environment variables for server process
        env = os.environ.copy()

        # Start the server as a subprocess
        server_params = StdioServerParameters(
            command="python3", args=[server_script_path], env=env

        self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(
            ClientSession(self.stdio, self.write)
        )

        # Initialize the session
        await self.session.initialize()

        # List available tools
        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        print(
            "\nConnected to server with tools:", [tool.name for tool in response.tools]
        )
        return response.tools

    async def initialize_bedrock(self):

            return True
        except Exception as e:

            print(
                "Make sure you have the necessary AWS credentials and permissions set up."

```

The full client code is quite extensive but handles:

* Starting the MCP server as a subprocess
* Establishing an MCP session
* Connecting to AWS Bedrock
* Processing user queries by sending them to Claude
* Invoking tools when the model requests them
* Returning results back to the model

Running the Example 🏃‍♂️

To run this example:

``
python3 mcp_client.py mcp_server.py``



The client will start the server, connect to AWS Bedrock, and begin an interactive chat session.

Try these example prompts:

* "Please greet me, my name is Alex"
* "Let's play rock paper scissors. I choose paper"
* "Explain what MCP is"

### Why MCP Matters ✨

### How It Works 🔍

Let's break down the key components:


#### The Server Side 🏗️

The MCP server is built using FastMCP, which makes it easy to define tools using Python decorators:

``python
@mcp.tool()
async def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a person with their name and explain what MCP is."""
    return f"Hello {name}! Welcome to MCP. ..."``

Each tool:

* Has a clear signature with type hints
* Includes documentation via docstrings
* Performs a specific task that the LLM can invoke

#### The Client Side 🔄

The client coordinates between:

1. The MCP Server - Which hosts our tools
2. AWS Bedrock - Which provides access to Claude 3.5 Haiku
3. The User Interface - Which allows for interactive chat

When a user submits a query, the client:

1. Sends the query to Claude via Bedrock
2. Provides Claude with information about available tools
3. Intercepts tool calls, executing them via the MCP server
4. Returns the results back to Claude
5. Presents Claude's final response to the user


MCP solves several important challenges in LLM application development:

1. Standardization: Creates a common interface across different LLM providers
2. Separation of Concerns: Separates tool implementation from AI model
3. Type Safety: Provides clear contracts for data exchange
4. Security: Limits LLM access to only predefined capabilities
5. Portability: Makes it easy to swap out LLM providers
6. Composability: Allows building complex applications from simple components

Next Steps 🛤️

### Now that you've built your first MCP application, here are some ways to expand:


1. Add More Tools: Create tools for databases, APIs, or specialized calculations
2. Implement Resources: Add data sources LLMs can reference
3. Define Prompts: Create reusable prompt templates
4. Try Different Models: Test with different providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Cohere

Conclusion 🎯

The Model Context Protocol represents a significant step forward in standardizing how AI models interact with external tools and data. With fastMCP, you can quickly build powerful applications that leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs while adding your own custom functionality.

By adopting MCP early, you're future-proofing your AI applications and joining the growing ecosystem of interoperable AI tools. The simple example we've built today is just the beginning—MCP can support everything from simple prototypes to complex enterprise applications.

Happy building! 🤖🔌🚀
