### Core Features ðŸ’«

#### Steering Files

Think of steering files as your project's DNA. They're markdown documents that tell KIRO about your:

* Architecture
* Tech stack
* Conventions
* Project structure

To create them:

1. Click the ghost icon in the sidebar
2. Select "Generate Steering Docs"
3. Customize the generated files (product.md, structure.md, tech.md)

Pro tip: Add custom steering files like test-driven-development.md to enforce specific development practices!


#### Vibe Coding Mode

For quick tasks and exploration, use vibe coding through the agentic chat. Perfect for:

* Codebase questions
* Quick prototyping
* Experimental features

### Spec-Driven Development

This is where KIRO really shines. Here's the workflow:


1. Requirements Phase

* Describe your feature
* KIRO generates PM-style requirements
* Review and adjust as needed

1. Design Phase

* Technical design documentation
* TypeScript interfaces
* Architecture plans
* Implementation details

1. Implementation Phase

* Organized task list
* Step-by-step execution of each task that can be further refined from the Kiro chat
* Track progress

### Agent Hooks âš¡

Automate repetitive tasks with event-based triggers. Set up hooks for:

* Auto-documentation updates
* README maintenance
* Design system sync
* Project management integration

To create a hook:

1. Open the KIRO pane (ghost icon)
2. Click + next to "agent hooks"
3. Configure your automation

### MCP Server Integration

Extend KIRO's capabilities by connecting external services. Here's an example Asana integration:

``json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "asana": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.asana.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}``


### Real-World Impact ðŸŒŸ

The spec-driven approach has been particularly powerful for building production-ready features with teams.
