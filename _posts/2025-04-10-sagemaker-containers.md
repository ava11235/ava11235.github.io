Amazon SageMaker offers flexible container-based deployment options for both training and inference. Developers can use separate Docker images for training and inference code, or combine them into a single image.

#### Container Structure and Components
Basic Container Structure
The standard SageMaker container structure includes:

#### Key Components: 

Training Container
   
Handles model training process
Reads data from S3
Outputs model artifacts
Contains training algorithms and dependencies

Inference Container
   
Serves real-time predictions
Uses Flask for API endpoints
Includes nginx for load balancing
Contains model serving code

### Container Workflow

Development Phase

Developers can create custom containers or use pre-built ones [4]
Containers must implement specific SageMaker interfaces
Support for both training and inference or separate containers

Deployment Phase

Containers are registered with Amazon ECR
SageMaker manages container lifecycle
Automatic scaling based on demand

### Additional Insights:

Consider using multi-stage Docker builds to optimize container size
Implement proper error handling in container scripts
Monitor container metrics using CloudWatch
Use container health checks for improved reliability
